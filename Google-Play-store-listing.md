> Please only upload pictures that you took yourself and that have educational or historical or encyclopedic value.
> No selfies, no images downloaded from the Internet.
> Very welcome: Pictures of famous people, rare things, political events, festivals, monuments, landscapes, architecture, etc.

> Please enter a meaningful title and relevant categories for every image you upload. At least, describe what the picture shows and where it was taken. This will make your pictures more easily findable by Wikipedia editors. Pictures without a meaningful title and tags may be deleted.

> GPS-geocoded pictures are much more valuable. Please use an app like "Fine Geotag" to automatically add GPS latitude/longitude to your pictures.
