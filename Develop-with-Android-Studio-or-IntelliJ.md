1. [Download Android Studio][1] (recommended) or [IntelliJ][2].

2. Depending on what you want to do:
  - If you want to contribute to the source code, please fork the Git repository, it is easy: Go to https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/ and press the "Fork" button. Wait a few seconds, then click the "Clone" button on the page that appeared, and copy the Git URL (it looks like `git@github.com:yourname/apps-android-commons.git`).
- If you just want to compile the latest source code, but never intend to modify it, then use this Git URL: `git@github.com:commons-app/apps-android-commons.git`.

3. Open Android Studio/IntelliJ. Open the project:
	``File`` > ``New`` > ``Project from Version Control...`` > ``Git``  
	or  
	(From Quick Start menu): ``Check out project from Version Control``
4. Enter the Git URL you obtained at step 2. Specify a (new) local directory you would like to clone into and select ``OK``.

5. Press the Run button.
