# Coordinates

Pictures with a latitude/longitude are much more valuable, so please:

- Enable **geotagging** in your camera app (often labelled: *GPS (tags)*, *Location (tags)*, or *save location* and with an icon of a map pin marker)
- Before taking pictures, launch the free [GPS Locker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.silentlexx.gpslock) app. Another option is to install [Fine Geotag](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.finegeotag) which wakes up _just after_ a picture is taken and updates it with the current latitude/longitude, it is a bit less precise (especially if you travel fast) but consumes less battery. You can use an app such as [PhotoMap](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.bischofs.photomap) to check whether the pictures you take are correctly geolocalized or not.

You can also manually add or edit the location of your photos using [Geotag Photos Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tappytaps.android.geotagphotospro2) or [geoLLERY](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pkg.geollery).

# Need to be anonymous?

Pictures you upload may lead to your identity. Let's say you live under a dictatorship and take a picture revealing leaders corruption: you want to upload the picture to Commons but you probably do not want to be identified as the photographer or as the uploader. Below are a few steps you can take to reduce the risks of being identified, but remember that zero risk does not exist.

- Use a VPN
- Create a throwaway Wikimedia account without an email address, and only use it for that picture or set of pictures. Then afterwards avoid modifying these pictures with your usual account.
- Remove the EXIF from your picture. Only a few persons on Earth use the same camera model, same firmware version, same settings as you, and all of this information is available in the EXIF, making it easy to link from this picture to your other pictures. The application [Scrambled Exif](https://gitlab.com/juanitobananas/scrambled-exif) ([F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.jarsilio.android.scrambledeggsif/), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jarsilio.android.scrambledeggsif)) makes the process easy.
- Even lens/camera imperfections might theoretically allow a very motivated organization to match your pictures.
