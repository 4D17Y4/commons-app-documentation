# How we choose students

1. Rank students by merit, based on:
  - Number and difficulty of merged pull requests
  - Quality of code
  - Communication skills
  - Extra points for previous open source project participation, helping others, and more.
2. Ask the 1st placed student whether they prefer Outreachy (if eligible) or GSoC.
3. If Outreachy was chosen at step 2, then the GSoC project will go to the student who was placed 2nd. If GSoC was chosen at step 2, then the Outreachy project will go to the 2nd-ranked student if eligible, or 3rd-ranked student if eligible, etc.

As a consequence, students are encouraged to apply to both GSoC and Outreachy (if eligible).
