Title: `Take screenshots of Commons Android app in your native language`

Description:
```
The Commons app allows Android users from all around the world to upload pictures for use in Wikipedia, Wikivoyage, etc.

As part of the app's localized documentation, we need screenshots in as many languages as possible.

Your task is to take screenshots of the app in your own native language.

Steps:

1) Claim this task, and post a comment saying what is your native language, for instance "Telugu".

2) Follow the instructions at https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/issues/960#issue-274097308 to take the required screenshots and send us a Git pull request.

3) Post the URL to your pull request here, then submit for review.

Note for people who have several native languages: Please choose your language which is the lowest on the list at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers, or one which is not in that article. For instance, if you can fluently speak both Telugu and English, please choose Telugu. If you can fluently speak both Italian and Slovenian, please choose Slovenian because it is not on that list. Please avoid English, because we will probably get enough screenshots in English.
