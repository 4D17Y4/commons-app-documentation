## Sample generation methodology

1. Go to https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Random/File
2. Try another if not inspiring
3. Without looking at anything below the image (just looking at the image and image name), imagine what an average might type to search for the appropriate category(ies).
4. Add a sample below. Include the thumbnail that can be found at the bottom of the Commons page, all the strings you have thought about, and the actual category.

## Sample 1

- apartment building
- Residential building
- Four-storeys house

Actual category: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Houses_in_South_Yorkshire
I would argue that https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Apartment_buildings would apply too.
