Task: Identify the best strategy/APIs to find Commons categories that are within a certain radius of specified GPS coordinates.

Pictures are found by:

1. Visiting https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Random/File
2. Eliminating files that are not photos or could not possibly be obtained via a smartphone
3. File must have location data available
