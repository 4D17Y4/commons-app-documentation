How to install and use the app:

1. Download **Wikimedia Commons** from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.free.nrw.commons)
2. Take a picture of something interesting (see: [What files are OK to upload](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Project_scope#Scope_part_1:_Files))
3. In your camera app, click to view the picture you just took
4. Press "Share"
5. Select **Upload to Commons**  
   The first time you will need to log in (if you don't have an account, create one for free [here](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&type=signup))
6. Enter a name and description for the picture
7. Enter as many relevant categories as possible (see: [Categorization tips](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Categories#Categorization_tips))
8. Press **Save**

Pictures with a latitude/longitude are much more valuable, so please:

- Enable **geotagging** in your camera app (often labelled: *GPS (tags)*, *Location (tags)*, or *save location* and with an icon of a map pin marker)
- Before taking pictures, launch the free [GPS Locker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.silentlexx.gpslock) app. Another option is to install [Fine Geotag](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.finegeotag) which wakes up _just after_ a picture is taken and updates it with the current latitude/longitude, it is a bit less precise (especially if you travel fast) but consumes less battery. You can use an app such as [PhotoMap](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.bischofs.photomap) to check whether the pictures you take are correctly geolocalized or not.

You can also manually add or edit the location of your photos using [Geotag Photos Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tappytaps.android.geotagphotospro2) or [geoLLERY](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pkg.geollery).
