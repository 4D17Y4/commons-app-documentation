Before May 6, we will:
1. Rank students by merit
2. Ask the 1st placed student whether they prefer Outreachy (if eligible) or GSoC.
3. If Outreachy was chosen at step 2, then we will the GSoC project will go to the student who placed 2nd. If GSoC was chosen at step 2, then the Outreadchy project will go to the 2nd-ranked student if eligible, or 3rd-ranked student if eligible, etc.

Students are encouraged to apply to both GSoC and Outreachy (if eligible).
