### Body
What do you want to tell the world? Write it here. Ideas on introductions and writing style can be found in our community guidelines.

The Wikimedia Commons Android app (url) allows contributors to easily submit photos directly from their phone to Commons without needing to use a browser. Recently, version 2.0 of the app was released, one and a half years after the app was revived by the community. The new version contains several improvements that make the app smoother and more convenient to use, as well as a new feature that displays nearby locations that need images.

In version 2.0, you can:

**View nearby places that need images.** This way you can help Wikipedia to have images for all articles, and you will discover beautiful places close to you.

**Do more with titles.** The app suggests categories based on the title that you chose for your image, and you can copy the title and description from your previous upload.

**Be notified if you have submitted this image before.** Can't remember if you have already uploaded a particular image? No problems, just select the image and you will be notified if a duplicate is found in the Commons database.

**Share the app with your friends.** It's easier than ever to get started with contributing to Commons - your friends can sign up for a Commons account within the app. The new tutorial gives them a quick primer on what type of photos Commons does and doesn't accept.

**Select licenses from the upload screen.** Licenses have been updated to include CC-BY 4.0 and CC-BY-SA 4.0, and you can now select your license directly when uploading.
