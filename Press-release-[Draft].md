### Body

The Wikimedia Commons Android app [url] allows contributors to easily submit photos directly from their phone to Commons without needing to use a browser. Recently, version 2.0 of the app was released, one and a half years after the app was revived by the community. The new version contains several improvements that make the app smoother and more convenient to use, as well as a new feature that displays nearby locations that need images.

In version 2.0, you can:

**View nearby places that need images.** Browse nearby locations that need images so you can help Wikipedia to have images for all articles, and discover beautiful places close to you.

**Do more with titles.** The app suggests categories based on the title that you chose for your image, and you can copy the title and description from your previous upload.

**Be notified if you have submitted this image before.** Can't remember if you have already uploaded a particular image? No problems, just select the image and you will be notified if a duplicate is found in the Commons database.

**Get your friends started with contributing to Commons.** It's easier than ever to get started with contributing to Commons - your friends can sign up for a Commons account within the app. The new tutorial gives them a quick primer on what type of photos Commons does and doesn't accept.

**Select licenses from the upload screen.** Licenses have been updated to include CC-BY 4.0 and CC-BY-SA 4.0, and you can now select your license directly when uploading.

**Switch to a light theme.** You can now choose between night mode or a new light theme, which is more suited to daytime or outdoor conditions. This can be toggled in Settings.

**Participate in beta testing.** Sign up for beta testing [url] to help us test the app and get new features before they are released to the public!

Download the app for free (no ads or in-app purchases) in the Google Play Store [url] or F-Droid [url]. More information can be found on our website [url], and the source code is available on GitHub [url] under the Apache License 2.0. As this is a community-maintained app, feedback and help from volunteers is always welcome.
