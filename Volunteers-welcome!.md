It is recommended that you actually try the app and upload pictures with it. Become familiar with the various workflows. Notice what kind of categories are suggested depending on where the picture is taken or what you type. Check what people consider [excellent pictures](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Featured_pictures) and get inspired by their rich descriptions and accurate categories.
